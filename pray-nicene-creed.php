<p>Together, let us proclaim our faith.</p>

<?php $sm->note("The term \"Apostolic\" as it appears in the Creed is not a reference to Apostolic Succession, but to Apostolic Tradition."); ?>

<p><u>I believe in one God the Almighty Father creator of heaven and earth and of everything visible and invisible.</u></p>
<p><u>And I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ the only son of God, born of the Father before all ages,</u></p>
<p><u>God of God, Light of light, true God of true God,</u></p>
<p><u>Of One Being with the Father, by Whom all things where made.</u></p>
<p><u>Who came down from heaven for us to save us - and for that purpose He was conceived through the power of Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary and became Human.</u></p>
<p><u>He was also  crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered death and was buried;</u></p>
<p><u>On the third day He rose again, as it is written in the scriptures,</u></p>
<p><u>And ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father,</u></p>
<p><u>And He shall return in glory to judge the living and the dead and His kingdom shall be endless.</u></p>
<p><u>And I believe in the Holy Spirit, Lord and life-giver, who proceeds from the Father,</u></p>
<p><u>Together with the Father and the Son She is worshipped and glorified.</u></p>
<p><u>She has spoken through the prophets.</u></p>
<p><u>And I believe in One holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins, I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life in the world  to come.</u></p>
<p><u>Amen!</u></p>

<p>
Thanks to Brother Andrew Blair for translating the
Creed for this project.
Modifications were later made, however, to make
the inclusivity more apparent in the modern context.
