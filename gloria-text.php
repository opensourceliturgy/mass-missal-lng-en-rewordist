<p><u>
Glory be to God on high,
and on earth, peace to those of good will.
We praise thee; we bless thee;
we adore thee;
we glorify thee.
We give thee thanks for thy great glory, O Lord God,
heavenly King,
God the Father Almighty,
O Lord Jesus Christ,
the only begotten Son.
O Lord God, Lamb of God,
Son of the Father,
who takest away the sins
of the world,
have mercy on us.
Who takest away the sins
of the world,
receive our prayers.
Who sittest at the right hand of the
Father,
have mercy on us.
For thou only art holy.
Thou only art the Lord.
Thou only, O Jesus Christ,
together with the Holy Spirit,
art most high in the glory of God the Father.
</u></p>

<p><u>Amen.</u></p>
